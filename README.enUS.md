# OmniStack Week 11 v1.0 [#Portuguese version](./README.md)

Project developed at OmniStack Week 11

It is structured as follows:

- Backend
- Fronted
- Mobile

## Backend

Developed with `Javascript`, making use of `node.js` and `express`, uses `SQLite` database, database integration was made with `knex` giving us flexibility to select other SQL databases to work with. Beisdes that, data validation is done with `celebrate`, a library which uses the `Joi` lib under the hood.

For unit and integration testing, `jest` was the choice.

## Frontend

Developed with `ReactJS` and `axios` for backend communication.

## Mobile

Use `Expo` platform and `React Native` framework for development, and just like frontend uses `axios` to estabilish contact with backend.
